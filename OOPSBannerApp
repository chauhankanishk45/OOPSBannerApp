* 00PSBannerApp UC2 - Banner Display Application
*
* This class demonstrates the creation of a visual banner displaying the word "00PS"
* using ASCII art composed of asterisks (*) and spaces. The banner is printed to the
* console using individual print statements for each line, creating a decorative
* text effect.

* <p>The banner is generated by printing predefined string patterns line by line,
* where each line contributes to forming the letters 0, 0, P, and S in a stylized format.
* This extends a basic user story by adding visual presentation to a simple message output.
